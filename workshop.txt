description=[td][h3]If you're playing on MP and don't see the receipe you need to enable it in workshop to get clients to download the mod - but you also have to add it to the mods list too.[/h3][/td]
description=[td][h3]If you are turning mods on on-going saves you need to enable the mod in the load menu for that save. This is done in the more menu in the loading save menu.[/h3][/td]

description=[b]Do I need to start a new game?[/b] No, you just need to craft a journal to get started.
description=
description=[b]Is it safe to remove this mod mid-play?[/b] Yes. However, removing it will delete the journals held and any progress stored in them; Players will have to re-craft them.
description=
description=[b]Where do I find the journals?[/b] You craft them. The recipe can be found under "bind journal" or under your native language's translation.
description=
description=[b]How do I use the journal?[/b] You will see the option to "transcribe journal" when you have a writing tool and bound journal (that is unclaimed or one you've written in before.) Trying to transcribe or read another person's journal in MP will not work (outside of COOP).
description=
description=[b]How does it work?[/b] The journals save skill's respective XP - ignoring profession/trait starter levels. There is also a sandbox option to lower return percentage (default is 100%). As well as options for types of XP saved, based on skill category, TV shows, and bonus multipliers from starting levels. By default, TV and bonus XP are disabled.
description=
description=[b]Are these journals one time use?[/b] No, you are expected to keep using the same journal and updating it over time. Unless you toggle the one-time use, which makes it so XP is depleted.
description=
description=[b]Are recipes saved?[/b] Yes, except for profession/trait gained (just like skill levels).
description=
description=[b]Warning:[/b] Journals have to be manually updated using a pen or pencil. You can check the tool-tip for XP and recipes. Careful if you die holding your journal as it may be difficult to retrieve it from your moving corpse or it could be stolen/destroyed by other players.
